= Angular Test Bed

The Angular Test Bed (ATB) is a higher level _Angular Only_ testing framework that allows us to easily test behaviours that depend on the Angular Framework.

We still write our tests in Jasmine and run using Karma but we now have a slightly easier way to create components, handle injection, test asynchronous behaviour and interact with our application.

This lecture will be an introduction to the ATB and we will continue to use it for the rest of this section.

== Learning Objectives

* What is the ATB and how to use it.
* When to use ATB vs. plain vanilla Jasmine tests.

== Configuring

Lets demonstrate how to use the _ATB_ by converting the component we tested with plain vanilla Jasmine to one that uses the _ATB_.

[source,typescript]
----
/* tslint:disable:no-unused-variable */
import {TestBed, ComponentFixture} from '@angular/core/testing';
import {LoginComponent} from './login.component';
import {AuthService} from "./auth.service";

describe('Component: Login', () => {

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [LoginComponent],
      providers: [AuthService]
    });
  });
});
----

In the `beforeEach` function for our test suite we _configure_ a testing module using the `TestBed` class.

This creates a test _Angular Module_ which we can use to instantiate components, perform dependency injection and so on.

We configure it in exactly the same way as we would configure a normal `NgModule`. On this case we pass in the `LoginComponent` in the declarations and the `AuthService` in the providers.

== Fixtures and DI

Once the ATB is setup we can then use it to instantiate components and resolve dependencies, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
/* tslint:disable:no-unused-variable */
import {TestBed, ComponentFixture} from '@angular/core/testing';
import {LoginComponent} from './login.component';
import {AuthService} from "./auth.service";

describe('Component: Login', () => {

  let component: LoginComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<LoginComponent>; # <1>
  let authService: AuthService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [LoginComponent],
      providers: [AuthService]
    });

    // create component and test fixture
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(LoginComponent); # <2>

    // get test component from the fixture
    component = fixture.componentInstance; # <3>

    // UserService provided to the TestBed
    authService = TestBed.get(AuthService); # <4>

  });
});
----
<1> A `fixture` is a wrapper for a component _and_ it's template.
<2> We create an instance of a component fixture through the `TestBed`, this injects the `AuthService` into the component constructor.
<3> We can find the actual _component_ from the `componentInstance` on the `fixture`.
<4> We can get resolve dependencies using the TestBed injector by using the `get` function.

NOTE: Since the `LoginComponent` doesn't have it's own child injector the AuthService that gets injected in is the same one as we get from the `TestBed` above.

== Test specs

Now we've configured the `TestBed` and extracted the component and service we can run through the same test specs as before:

[source,typescript]
----
it('canLogin returns false when the user is not authenticated', () => {
  spyOn(authService, 'isAuthenticated').and.returnValue(false);
  expect(component.needsLogin()).toBeTruthy();
  expect(authService.isAuthenticated).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

it('canLogin returns false when the user is not authenticated', () => {
  spyOn(authService, 'isAuthenticated').and.returnValue(true);
  expect(component.needsLogin()).toBeFalsy();
  expect(authService.isAuthenticated).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
----


== When to use ATB

We will continue to use ATB for the rest of this section because:

* It allows us to test the interaction of a directive or component with it's template.
* It allows us to easily test change detection.
* It allows us to test and use Angulars DI framework,
* It allows us to test using the `NgModule` configuration we use in our application.
* It allows us to test user interaction via clicks & input fields

== Summary

The ATB lets us test parts of our code as if it is being run in the context of a real Angular app.

It's usefulness will become more apparent in future lectures, the next one being how to use the ATB to test change detection and property binding.
